Battuta’s Search Engine

Battuta’s Search is a Java-based search engine dedicated to Ibn Battuta, the renowned explorer. This project combines Java, Jetty Servlets, and HTML to create a versatile and efficient search experience. The search engine incorporates various features, including multithreading, HTML cleaning to prevent injection, and integration with the Buma framework.

Features

    Multithreading: The engine leverages a custom multithreading class, allowing for efficient concurrent processing. This enhances performance, particularly when handling large datasets.

    HTML Cleaner: A dedicated HTML cleaner has been implemented to prevent HTML injection, ensuring a secure and clean user interaction. This feature enhances the reliability of the search engine by filtering and sanitizing input.

    Jetty Servlets: The Jetty Servlets framework is employed for server-side functionality, providing a robust foundation for handling HTTP requests and responses. This choice contributes to the scalability and responsiveness of the search engine.

    Web Crawling: The search engine supports crawling through websites, enabling the retrieval of information from online sources. This feature broadens the scope of data that can be processed and indexed by the search engine.

    Query Processing: Users can input queries to retrieve relevant information from the indexed data. The engine processes queries efficiently, delivering accurate and timely results.

    JSON Output: The search engine generates JSON output files for various purposes, including word counts, index information, and query results. This facilitates easy integration with other tools and applications.

    Search Server: A search server with search history functionality is implemented. This server allows users to interact with the search engine through a user-friendly interface.
